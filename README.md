# Multi-threaded Rsync Script

## Description

This Python script offers a multi-threaded solution for efficiently copying files from a remote server to a local directory using `rsync`. It's particularly beneficial for transferring a large number of files or handling large-sized files, as it divides the workload across multiple threads. This method can significantly accelerate the transfer process compared to a single-threaded `rsync` operation.

The script initially conducts a dry-run of the `rsync` command to compile a list of all files that need to be transferred. This list is then segmented into smaller chunks, with each chunk assigned to a separate thread. The number of threads is dynamically adjusted based on the total number of files, optimizing resource utilization and transfer efficiency.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `rsync` installed on both the local machine and the remote server
- SSH access to the remote server (for remote file transfers)

## Usage

### Configuration

- Set the `remote_path` variable to the path of the directory on the remote server.
- Set the `local_path` variable to the path of the target directory on the local machine.
- Set the `dry_run_output` variable to the path where the dry-run output file will be saved.

### Execution

- Run the script using Python 3. For example: `python3 rsync_multithread.py`.

### Monitoring

- The script outputs the progress of the file transfer, which can be monitored for any errors or issues.

## Note

- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access both the remote and local paths.
- Use this script with caution and test it in a controlled environment first, particularly when handling important or sensitive data.
- The efficiency gain from multi-threading is subject to network conditions, the performance of the source and destination systems, and the size and number of files.
